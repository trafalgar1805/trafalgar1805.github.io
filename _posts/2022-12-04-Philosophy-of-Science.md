# (RL) Philosophy of Science

1. Causation and Counterfactuals. LA Paul
2. Model Cases On Canonical Research Objects and Sites. Krause
3. Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact. Fleck
4. ~~What is this thing called science? Chalmers~~
5. The logic of scientific discovery . Popper
6. Interpretation and Social Knowledge. Reed
7. ~~Theory and Reality. Godfrey-Smith~~
8. ~~Against Method. Feyerabend~~ (According to Godfrey-Smith some people read Feyerabend as an enemy of science, but he sees him as an enemy of normal science. Agaisnt scientist without creativity that do the ant work of normal science. I wonder if the expansion of higher education and PhD in particular has accentuated this part of science in the last decades. Maybe some other mechanisms have intervened too. A casual observation is that, in Sociology, papers published before roughly 1980 seem more original and creative that nowadays. Maybe James Evans has something to say about this.)
9. Labyrinths of reason. Poundstone (A popular science book on analytical philosophy, recommended in [Bactra]{http://bactra.org/reviews/labyrinths-of-reason/})


## On Realism

1. Mearsheimer, J. J. (2007). Structural realism. _International relations theories: Discipline and diversity_, _83_, 77-94. (Structural realism claims that successful theories might be good at capturing the structure of reality but not its substance, which is why they can be really good at prediction and yet get the gist of the matter wrong, like Newton's law of gravity. I include it because it reminded me of potential issues of structuralism in Sociology).  

2. Van Fraassen, B. C. (1980). _The scientific image_. Oxford University Press.

3. Hardimon Michael. Rethinking Race: The Case for Deflationary Realism. Harvard University Press. (Notes: Deflationary realism. Which means that it recognizes that race is not merely socially constructed, it has real features. Also, consequences of the socially constructed view of race have real consequences). 

## Causation
1. Lewis, D. (1974). Causation. _The journal of philosophy_, _70_(17)
2. Counterfactuals. Lewis
